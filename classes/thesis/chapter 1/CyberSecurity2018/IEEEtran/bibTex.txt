ABSTRACT="We propose a fully Bayesian learning approach using reversible jump Markov
chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) for asymmetric Gaussian mixtures (AGM). Compared
to classic Gaussian mixture model, AGM doesn't imply that target data is
symmetric which brings flexibility and better fitting results. This paper
also introduces a RJMCMC learning implementation based on
Metropolis-Hastings (MH) within Gibbs sampling method. As an improvement of
traditional sampling-based MCMC learning, RJMCMC has no assumption
concerning the number of components and, therefore, the AGM model itself
could be transferred between iterations. For better evaluating models with
different mixture components number, the model selection is achieved by
calculating integrated likelihood using Laplace approximation to figure out
the best-fit components number. We selected both synthetic and a
challenging spam filtering datasets to show the merits of the proposed
model."
